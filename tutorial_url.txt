ran into issues installing mongo tonight
todo tomorrow: finish the mongoose backend section and 'Wiring It All Up'; skip the authentication and user stuff until after finished with the textbooks that are coming in tomorrow. May come back to it eventually, but having a simple running webapp is good enough for my purposes.
